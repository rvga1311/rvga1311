<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Roy Garc√≠a üëãüíª <img height="40"</h1>
<h3 align="center">Computer Science Engineering student at the Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica</h3>

-------------------
I'm Roy Vinicio Garc√≠a Alvarado, a final year computer science engineering student currently completing my last semester of theoretical and practical courses. Next semester, I'll be doing my professional internship to complete my degree. I'm a collaborative teamworker with excellent communication skills, adaptable, and always willing to learn new skills. I'm strong at problem-solving and critical thinking and can manage multiple projects with ease. I have experience in developing documentation, testing, and software, creating websites, desktop applications, and video games using Unity/C# and C. Additionally, I have knowledge in various computer science areas such as operating systems, compilers, languages, databases, and algorithms for data analysis.

-------------------
  
## Here are some projects I have collaborated:
+ [Lonely Walls (Backrooms Game)](https://juuzou13.itch.io/lonely-walls) :video_game:
+ [Lost In The Frost](https://juuzou13.itch.io/lostinthefrost) :video_game:
+ [Tetris](https://lanzerth13.itch.io/tetris) :video_game:
  
Under the nickname Lanzerth13, I've contributed to the development of three different games, which are published on itch.io. In each of these games, I've helped in various positions, including game mechanic development, interface creation, writing, level design, 2D/3D animation, and sound design for each of these projects. I'm proud of my contributions to these games and I hope players enjoy them as much as we did creating them!

The repositories for these projects are no longer available, as they were removed at the end of the free trial period for Plastic SCM. In addition, due to compatibility issues, our team has decided not to host the repositories on GitHub. However, if someone wishes to obtain the source code, they can contact one of the game developers.
